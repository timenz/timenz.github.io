There are some attempt by javascript realm to invade android development world and one of them is [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), _React Native_ enable us to create Android and IOS apps using [ReactJs](https://facebook.github.io/react/), framework that developed by [Facebook](https://code.facebook.com/).

## Pros
Like another javascript tools that invade mobile apps development world, react native offer to create Android and IOS apps using same codebase. From a small company manajer perspective it is painful to hire Xcode/Swift/ObjC and Android/Java programmers to create android and IOS apps, when someone told him both platform apps can created by a programmer with React/Js stack, its would be great news.

One other big pros about this framework is create mobile apps using javascript natively, not run in the webview or embedded browser, so the apps should run smootly rather than apps that depends on webview.

React Native also offer better debugging process, using _Live Reload_ apps will refreshed withaot recompiling.

## Cons

You can not using standard HTML tags in React Native, React Native provide specials components to build views and also you can not using ReactJs components in your React Native project. And there are some another cons, if you dont have good knowledge in javascript.
